# Amsterdam High School CS, Robotics, and AI Program

This directory documents the design and successful implementation of a comprehensive
Computer Science, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence program at Amsterdam High School
(AHS), including the construction of a dedicated robotics lab and a multi-year course
sequence built in partnership with Fulton–Montgomery Community College (FMCC).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to move AHS from having a small number of standalone CS
offerings to a coherent 9–12 pathway that:

- Gives **all students** access to introductory CS experiences.
- Provides **advanced study** in CS, robotics, and AI for interested students.
- Leverages a **formal partnership with FMCC** so that upper-level high school courses
  articulate directly to college credit and SUNY microcredentials.
- Is grounded in **hands-on, lab-based learning**, with a dedicated robotics space
  that supports iterative engineering and competitive VEX robotics experiences.

The documents in this directory capture the vision, course proposals, and lab design
work that were eventually used to launch the program and build out the new robotics lab.

## Key Components

### 1. CS & Robotics Course Sequence

The proposal lays out a full sequence of high school and college-level courses, including:

- **Explorations in Programming** – a half-credit, graphics-focused Python course that
  introduces core programming concepts and culminates in creative, student-designed
  projects.
- **Explorations in Robotics** – a half-credit, project-based robotics course that blends
  iterative engineering with Python programming through classroom challenges.
- **Robotics (full year)** – a more advanced robotics course where students tackle
  larger, competition-style challenges with more capable robots and more complex code.
- **Computer Science I (CIS-116)** – a full-year, dual-enrollment course aligned with
  FMCC’s introductory programming syllabus, serving as a gateway to additional college-level
  offerings.
- Future offerings (documented in the proposal) such as **Computer Science II (CIS-216)**
  and **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** to extend the pathway into advanced CS/AI.

Taken together, these courses form a pipeline from “first exposure” in CS/robotics to
college-level work in algorithms, data structures, and AI.

### 2. Robotics Lab Design and Implementation

A core requirement of the program was a **dedicated robotics lab** where:

- VEX competition fields could remain assembled for long-term design and testing.
- Students had access to specialized furniture, part storage, and flexible workspaces.
- The room could also support **distance learning**, enabling CS courses to be shared
  with other schools via the DL network.

The included lab layout and furniture plan specify:

- A raised VEX V5 arena and space for IQ/EXP fields.
- Standing student tables with integrated locker storage.
- Dedicated part and equipment storage for multiple VEX platforms.
- Teacher workstation, whiteboards, and interactive display hardware.

This design was used as the basis for the build-out of the new robotics lab, which now
serves as the physical hub for CS, robotics, and AI instruction at AHS.

### 3. Partnership with FMCC and SUNY Microcredentials

The program is intentionally aligned with **FMCC’s Computer Science curriculum**, so that:

- AHS students can earn **college credit** in CIS-116 (and future CIS-216 / AI electives).
- Course sequences can be bundled into **SUNY microcredentials**, giving students
  portable recognition of their CS/AI skills.
- FMCC faculty collaboration supports rigorous syllabi, assessment alignment, and
  pathways into additional CS coursework on the FMCC campus.

This partnership also helps address regional needs for CS-certified teachers and
creates a model for sharing CS/AI opportunities with neighboring districts.
