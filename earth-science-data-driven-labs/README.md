# Data-Driven Earth Science Labs (Secondary Level)

This directory contains a set of three Earth Science laboratory investigations I developed
for high school students (circa 2017). Each lab is built around authentic or realistic
datasets and map-based representations, and requires students to analyze quantitative
data, perform calculations, and communicate evidence-based conclusions.

These labs illustrate my long-standing work in **data-rich, inquiry-based STEM
curriculum design**, prior to my current focus on computer science and AI education.

## Overview of Labs

### 1. Exploring the Orbits of Earth and Mars

In this investigation, students model the elliptical orbits of Earth and Mars, then use
their measurements to calculate orbital properties and reason about mission design to
Mars. The materials are split into a **procedure** and a **lab report** handout.

Students:

- Measure **aphelion**, **perihelion**, the **distance between foci**, and the **length of
  the major axis** for each planet on a scaled diagram.
- Compute **eccentricity** using \( e = \frac{\text{distance between foci}}{\text{length of
  major axis}} \) and compare to accepted values from reference tables, including %
  error.
- Convert period of revolution from days → hours → seconds and calculate the
  **circumference of the orbit** and **orbital velocity** in both km/s and miles/hour.
- Analyze how differences in orbital shape and speed relate to the challenges of
  launching successful manned or unmanned missions to Mars.

The lab report sheet guides students through data tables, analysis questions, and
open-ended prompts on mission navigation and sources of error. 

### 2. Hurricane Irene and the Gilboa Dam

This lab combines **topographic maps**, **USGS stream-gauge data**, and **population
data** to explore flood risk along the Schoharie Creek and Mohawk River during
Hurricane Irene, and to model the potential impacts of a hypothetical Gilboa Dam
failure. 

Students:

- Use census and mapping tools to determine populations of affected communities
  (Schoharie Village, Amsterdam, Cohoes) and plot their locations on a base map. 
- Determine surface elevations and river directions using **topographic maps** (Maps A–D),
  then compute **flood elevations** from Hurricane Irene using historical USGS stage
  data. 
- Model a **worst-case scenario** by adding an estimated additional water height from a
  catastrophic Gilboa Dam failure and calculate new maximum water elevations. 
- Create **inundation maps** for Amsterdam and Schoharie, shading areas affected by
  Irene alone and those that would also be impacted by a dam failure.
- Write narrative responses describing likely damage, affected infrastructure, and
  policy recommendations for local governments. 

This lab integrates Earth Science content (flooding, watersheds, topography) with
civic-relevance and risk assessment.

### 3. Investigating the Taku Glacier

In this lab, students analyze historical maps of the **Taku Glacier** in Alaska to compute
rates of glacial advance, predict future positions of the terminus, and interpret the
results in the context of glacial budgets and climate change. 

Students:

- Use mapped historical terminus positions (1909, 1931, 1948) to calculate **rates of
  movement** in km/year and construct a **glacial budget** over different time spans. 
- Predict the position of the glacier terminus for 1980 and compare their predictions
  to actual map data. 
- Repeat the process using a 1980 map to forecast the terminus position in 2019, then
  check against the current position using Google Earth. 
- Reflect on why their predictions differ from reality and discuss factors affecting
  glacial advance/retreat (temperature, precipitation, climate trends). 
- Extend the reasoning to another glacier (Rhone Glacier, Switzerland) using paired
  historical and modern imagery to consider regional impacts of glacier loss.
