# AI & CS Education Portfolio

This repository collects curriculum and instructional materials I have developed for artificial intelligence and computer science education at both the K–12 and undergraduate levels. Materials include:

- **Undergraduate coursework**
  - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning minor curriculum at SUNY Polytechnic Institute
  - Example labs and projects from the *Artificial Intelligence Applications* course (e.g., NEAT / Lunar Lander assignment)

- **K–12 curriculum**
  - Computer science and AI course sequences designed for secondary schools
  - Standards-aligned modules and supporting resources for teachers

These materials are shared to support AI/CS education, teacher professional development, and broader efforts to integrate AI literacy into secondary and postsecondary learning environments.
