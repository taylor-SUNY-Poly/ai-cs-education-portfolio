# SUNY Polytechnic Institute – Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Minor

This directory documents my contributions to the design and successful approval of the
**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Minor** at SUNY Polytechnic Institute,
slated to launch in **Spring 2026**. The minor was developed collaboratively with
colleagues in the Department of Computer Science and is designed to give students from
a wide range of majors a rigorous, hands-on pathway into AI and machine learning.

## Program Overview

The AI & Machine Learning minor combines AI literacy, application-driven coursework,
and advanced project work. As outlined in the curriculum brief, the minor includes:

- **CS 195 – Artificial Intelligence Literacy**  
  Covers SUNY’s 2026 AI General Education criteria and provides a broad foundation in
  AI concepts, societal impacts, and ethical considerations.
- **CS 100 or CS 108 – Introductory Programming**  
  Ensures all students have a solid programming base.
- **CS 295 – Artificial Intelligence Applications**  
  An application-focused AI course emphasizing practical projects in Python.
- **CS 395 – Machine Learning Concepts**  
  A theory and methods course in machine learning.
- **CS 459 – AI & Machine Learning Projects**  
  A capstone-style practicum where students design and deliver multiple AI/ML projects.

Students are also encouraged to take **CS 495** as an elective to extend their studies
into additional advanced AI topics.

The minor targets students in majors such as **computer science/applied computing,
biology, business/finance, mathematics, health sciences, sociology, communications,
engineering/technology, and game design**, emphasizing the cross-disciplinary value of
AI/ML skills.

## Key Courses in This Directory

This directory includes materials for two anchor courses in the minor, both of which I
had major responsibility in shaping.

### CS 295 – Artificial Intelligence Applications

**CS 295** is an application-driven introduction to AI that blends fundamental CS skills
with modern machine learning tools. The course:

- Reviews Python programming and introduces key data structures (queues, trees, graphs).
- Uses libraries such as **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Keras/TensorFlow**.
- Covers:
  - Predictive analytics (classification and regression)
  - Neural networks and pre-trained models for image recognition
  - Neuroevolutionary learning with genetic algorithms
  - Reinforcement learning with neural networks
- Emphasizes hands-on projects where students implement and evaluate AI systems.

The course is structured around projects, exams, and problem sets, with an emphasis on
students’ ability to **build, analyze, and explain** real AI applications.

### CS 459 – AI & Machine Learning Projects

**CS 459** functions as a practicum / capstone for the minor. Students work in small
teams to design and implement multiple AI/ML projects over the semester. The syllabus
emphasizes:

- Project ideation and scoping in evolving AI/ML domains
- Identification of appropriate AI/ML technologies and data sources
- Iterative project lifecycles, including post-mortems and redesigns
- Critical reflection on **societal impact, ethics, and bias** in AI systems

Teams complete three substantial projects, each with:

- A working AI/ML prototype
- An oral presentation
- A written technology and social-issues report

The course explicitly addresses the **ethical and transparent use of AI tools**, requiring
students to cite any external models, datasets, or generative outputs and to maintain
genuine intellectual ownership of their work.

## Role in the Minor

Together, the materials in this directory show how the AI & ML minor:

- Builds from **AI literacy** and **introductory programming** into
  **application-focused AI**, **machine learning theory**, and **project-based
  practice**.
- Positions CS 295 as a **gateway course** into AI that is accessible to students
  from many disciplines.
- Uses CS 459 as a **capstone experience**, where students integrate technical skills
  with ethical reflection and real-world project delivery.

These documents collectively demonstrate a coherent, scaffolded AI/ML curriculum that
supports SUNY Poly students in developing practical AI skills and preparing for further
work in machine learning, data science, and related fields.
